# A test graphql backend

## How to run
- npm i
- npm run start
- open browser at http://localhost:4000/
- enjoy

  

## The task
Implement a react app using this graphql backend. App contains a **list of news** with *title*, *date*, *author* and a *number of likes*. Every news could be opened in a separate page with a verbose data (*all the fields*) with a buttons to **like**/**dislike** and **delete** the news.

## Notes
- App design doesn't matter
- Backend app can't be changed
- Supplemental data refreshes are considered to be a bad practice
